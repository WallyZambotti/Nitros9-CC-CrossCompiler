The file 'cc.patch' contains diffs to the clib sources and various
Makefiles.  No modifications have been made to the preprocessor,
compiler and optimizer.

The 'dd' subdirectory needs to be copied or symlinked under the root
directory, since that's where the preprocessor expects to find
headers.  This is a definite 'FIXME'.  When building for Linux, this
should come either from the command line or an environment variable.
