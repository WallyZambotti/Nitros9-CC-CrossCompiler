The cstart source file is originally from:

$NITROS9DIR/3rdparty/packages/cc/sources

The os9defs file is from:

$NITROS9DIR/3rdparty/libs/alib

The cstart source needed some massaging:

- Don't specify a path for the defs file.

- Set language/type byte non-zero so linker will know 
  that it's the main program.  The value will be set 
  to $11 by the linker when it writes its output.

- Change spelling of two symbols to agree with everything
  else in the universe.

Run build.sh to construct cstart.r and move it someplace
where the linker can find it.
