This version will assemble all the rma sources to rof's that are identical
to those compiled with the original rma on the coco.

Several warnings are produced, however
some have been eliminated.. We are going to change OptBPtr and d0791 from
ref_ent * to symblstr * hoping to clear up some warnings about mismatched
pointer types.
